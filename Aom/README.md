# USE FINAL FILE
use final file. it is a complete version of hellmetrix
## HOW TO CHANGE ANYTHING
Everything is ***id base*** mean if you dig down into my code you will a property call "mode" or something similar  
0 = empty starter  
1 = positive starter and will shoot bullet  
-1 = negative starter and will turn into empty starter when hit with bullet  
-2 = bullet  
2 = empty tile  
3 = turn up tile  
4 = turn down tile  
5 = turn left tile  
6 = turn right tile  
you can add more your mode id if you need just don't make it duplicate
